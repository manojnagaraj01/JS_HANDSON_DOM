        <summary><span>Question:08 </span>What's the difference between window vs document?</summary>
        <p class="question_08 ">In the context of web development and browser scripting, "document" and "window" refer to two different objects that are part of the Document Object Model (DOM) and represent different aspects of a web page. Here's the difference between them:</p>
        <table class="grid_container ">
            <tr>
                <th id="window">Window</th>
                <th id="document">Document</th>
            </tr>
                <td class="diff" id="diff_w1">The window object represents the browser window or tab in which the web page is loaded.</td>
                <td class="diff" id="diff_d1">The document object represents the HTML content of the current web page. It is a property of the global window object</td>
            <tr></tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="diff" id="diff_w2">It serves as the global object in the browser's JavaScript environment and provides methods and properties for controlling the browser and interacting with the user.</td>
                <td class="diff" id="diff_d2">It provides an interface to access and manipulate the elements, content, and structure of the web page.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="diff" id="diff_w3">The window object includes methods for opening new browser windows or tabs (open()), navigating to different URLs (location), setting timeouts/intervals (setTimeout(), setInterval()), and handling user interactions.</td>
                <td class="diff" id="diff_d3">You can use methods like getElementById(), querySelector(), and properties like innerHTML to modify the content of the web page.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="diff" id="diff_w4">The window object also encompasses properties related to the browser environment, such as the screen dimensions, history, and more.</td>
                <td class="diff" id="diff_d4">The document object is essentially a representation of the entire HTML document, including all its elements, text, and attributes.</td>  
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p class="question_08 ">In summary, the document object is focused on the content and structure of the web page itself, while the window object provides control over the browser window and its interactions with the user. They are both integral parts of web development and are used to create dynamic and interactive web pages.</p>
